Notes on compliance

- Our project code is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0). That license prohibits commercial use by third parties without express permission.

- The LGPL-3.0 library (`lamejs`) is a copyleft "weak" license: you may use it in combination with proprietary code, but when distributing a combined work, the rights and obligations of LGPL still apply with respect to the LGPL-covered components. For web/static distributions we include the LGPL text in `LICENSES/lgpl-3.0.txt` and provide a link to the upstream project.

- If you plan to redistribute the project in a commercial product, contact the author (see `LICENSE` contact info) to negotiate a commercial license. The author reserves exclusive commercial licensing rights for this project.
