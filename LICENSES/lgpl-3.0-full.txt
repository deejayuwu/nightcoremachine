										GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
											 Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

	This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

	0. Additional Definitions.

	As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the
GNU General Public License.

	"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

	An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using the interface provided by the Library.

	A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

	The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

	The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

	1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

	You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

	2. Conveying Modified Versions.

	If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

		a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
		ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
		function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
		whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

		b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
		this License applicable to that copy.

	3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

	The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and
templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the
following:

		a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
		Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
		covered by this License.

		b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
		license document.

	4. Combined Works.

	You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

		a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
		the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
		covered by this License.

		b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
		license document.

		c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
		execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these
		notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of
		the GNU GPL and this license document.

		d) Do one of the following:

			 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of
			 this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
			 suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
			 recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
			 the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
			 manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
			 Corresponding Source.

			 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
			 Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
			 a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
			 system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
			 of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
			 Version.

		e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would
		otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6
		of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
		necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
		Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application
		with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option
		4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
		Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you
		use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in
		the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
		Corresponding Source.)

	5. Combined Libraries.

	You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

		a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
		based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
		conveyed under the terms of this License.

		b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
		is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
		accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

	6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

	The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

	Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

	If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

	TERMINATION

	7. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
originally permitted under this License are properly called "use".
The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted,
and output from such a program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Library (independent of having been
made by running the Library).  Whether that is true depends on what the
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

	8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Library is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

	9. You may not convey a covered work under this License if you
have removed a notice stating that the work is governed by this
License and referring to the copy of this License provided with the
work.

	10. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of
the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) alleging that any patent law
or trademark law claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering
for sale, or importing the Library or any portion of it.

	NO WARRANTY

	11. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the
copyright holder and/or other parties provide the Library "as is",
without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality
and performance of the Library is with you.  Should the Library prove
defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or
correction.

	12. In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and
conveys the Library as permitted above, be liable to you for damages,
including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages
arising out of the use or inability to use the Library (including but
not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or
loss of business), even if such holder or other party has been
advised of the possibility of such damages.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

	If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under this License.  To apply these terms, attach the
following notices to the library.  It is safest to attach them to the
start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and
a pointer to where the full notice is found.

		<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
		Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

		This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
		it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as
		published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the
		License, or (at your option) any later version.

		This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
		but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
		MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
		Lesser General Public License for more details.

		You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
		License along with this library; if not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
